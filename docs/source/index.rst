Welcome to E-Market Data Explorer's documentation!
==================================================

**E-Market Data Explorer** is a Python crawler and exploratory data analysis(EDA) tool
for marketing specialties who would like to conduct the STP methods for working out
their marketing strategy for sale and promotion.

It pulls data from the e-commerce sites, such as Shopee, Amazon and PPT to the CSV file
and then user can explore CSV files or can make use of our EDA command to auto-generate the
EDA charts. AS a result, marketing folks can easily know about trends and insights from
data by looking at each chart.

**E-Market Data Explorer** is the subset of another our development effort in
STP python module (now it's under construction). When it's done, marketing staffs can
just use our toolbox to streamline the prior time-consuming processes of conducting
STP by typing a few clicks.

Check out the :doc:`get_started` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
